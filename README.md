## ✨ Features

### 🌟 Attack Methods

#### 🎮 Game Methods (14 Total):
- **Minecraft Handshake:** Floods Minecraft servers with fake handshake packets (0x00) to overwhelm connection handling.
- **Minecraft Login:** Sends repeated fake login attempts (0x02) with dummy usernames to stress authentication systems.
- **PUBG Packet:** Spams UDP packets tagged with "PUBG" to disrupt PUBG server traffic.
- **PUBG Connect:** Opens and closes TCP connections rapidly to exhaust PUBG server slots.
- **Black Ops 6 Spam:** Floods UDP packets with "BO6" tags to target Black Ops 6 servers.
- **Call of Duty Connect:** Overloads Call of Duty servers with TCP connection attempts.
- **CS:GO Query:** Bombards CS:GO servers with Source Engine query packets (`\xFF\xFF\xFF\xFF\x54`) to overload query handling.
- **Rust Connect:** Spams TCP connections to Rust servers, filling connection queues.
- **ARK Spam:** Sends UDP packets tagged "ARK" to stress ARK server resources.
- **Fortnite Packet:** Floods Fortnite servers with UDP packets marked "FORT".
- **Apex Legends Connect:** Barrages Apex Legends servers with TCP connection requests.
- **Valorant Spam:** Overloads Valorant servers with UDP packets tagged "VALO".
- **GTA Online Connect:** Spams TCP connections to GTA Online servers, targeting session limits.
- **Roblox Query:** Floods Roblox servers with UDP packets marked "RBX" to test query responses.

#### 🌊 Layer 4 UDP (9 Methods):
- 📦 **StdHex:** Sends UDP packets starting with hex "DEADBEEF" followed by random bytes for a consistent flood.
- 📜 **Plain:** Floods with simple UDP packets filled with "A" bytes, ideal for basic stress testing.
- 🔄 **Bypass:** Uses randomized payloads to evade simple packet filters.
- 💥 **Burst:** Launches high-intensity UDP bursts via multiple threads for sudden load spikes.
- 🌩️ **Storm:** Sustained UDP flood with "STORM" prefix for prolonged stress.
- 🏃 **Rush:** Rapid UDP packet bursts across 10 threads to simulate distributed traffic.
- 💣 **Blast:** Continuous flood with "BLAST" prefix and random data for sustained pressure.
- 🔊 **Amplification:** Exploits UDP amplification (e.g., game server queries like `\xFF\xFF\xFF\xFFgetstatus`) to amplify traffic.
- 🪞 **Reflection:** Simulates a reflection attack with spoofed-source UDP packets (simplified; full spoofing needs raw sockets).

#### ⚡ Layer 4 TCP (9 Methods):
- 🔗 **Bypass:** Floods with randomized TCP payloads to bypass basic filters.
- 🚪 **SYN:** Spams SYN packets to exhaust server connection tables.
- 🔑 **ACK:** Sends ACK packets post-connection to overwhelm TCP stacks.
- 🌐 **Connect:** Repeatedly opens and closes TCP connections to fill server slots.
- 🌊 **Wave:** Sustained TCP flood with "WAVE" payload for consistent pressure.
- ⚡ **Surge:** Rapid TCP connection spam to spike server load.
- 💥 **Crush:** Long-term TCP flood with "CRUSH" payload to test endurance.
- 🔄 **Rapid Reset:** Implements an HTTP/2-style rapid reset attack, quickly opening and closing connections to evade rate limits.
- 🎭 **Spoofed SYN:** Simulates a SYN flood with spoofed IPs (simplified; requires raw sockets for true spoofing).

#### 🌐 Layer 7 HTTP/HTTPS (8 Methods):
- 📊 **Slowloris:** Maintains many open connections with "keep-alive" headers to drain server resources slowly.
- 🔎 **HTTP Spam:** Rapid GET requests to overload HTTP servers.
- 🔒 **HTTPS Bypass:** Uses proxies and rotating User-Agents to flood HTTPS endpoints, bypassing basic protections.
- 🔥 **HTTP Fury:** Targets `/fury` with rapid GET requests for focused stress.
- ⚡ **HTTPS Strike:** Floods HTTPS endpoints with a custom User-Agent for sustained load.
- 📦 **HTTP Overload:** Sends POST requests with random 1KB data to stress server processing.
- ☁️ **Cloudflare Bypass:** Mimics legitimate traffic with forged headers (e.g., `CF-Connecting-IP`) to evade Cloudflare protections.
- 🤖 **Bot Emulation:** Emulates search engine bots (e.g., Googlebot) with proxy support to bypass bot detection.

### 🔍 CheckHost Diagnostics (4 Tools):
- 📡 **Ping IP:** Performs an ICMP ping to check target responsiveness (4 pings).
- 🌐 **HTTP Check:** Tests HTTP status using Check-Host.net, reporting response times and codes.
- ℹ️ **Target Info:** Fetches IP location, ASN, and connection stats via Check-Host.net.
- 🔗 **URL to IP:** Resolves a URL to its IP address using DNS lookup.

### 📥 Proxy Downloader:
- 📋 **Download Proxy List:** Grabs a fresh HTTP proxy list from a public source and saves it as `proxy_list.txt` in the script directory.
